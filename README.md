## TODO

Try to add 5 players back

Test on Ipad + Enable iPad support

Player Box
 - See and Track
   - Monarch
   - Initiative
 - Button + and -
   - if it's held, it added/removed points by 5 instead of 1 at the time. As an option (from: JaqueLeKappa)

UI & Glitch
 - Only gripe i really have with it is that I don't find it a bit unpolished visually (which is to be expected at at this stage and by no means is meant like an insult).

- Changing the image(Icon) in the background would be fun!
