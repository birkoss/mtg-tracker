# MTG Tracker

- Added Storm Count Tracker
- Added more options and customizations

## TODO Next Release

Is Dead Screen
  - Show the SETTINGS tabs with Is Dead Switch on click

Add Settings to track commander damage or not
  - Enabled by default

The app has been great so far. A piece of feedback: after assigning Commander damage, it should reset to the life total screen after a short period with no further inputs
  - I'll add an option named "Revert to life total after X seconds of inactivity", disabled by default. I'll apply this to all Trackers (commander, poison, etc..)
  - I would say 5 or 10 seconds personally. The app is very clean and easy to use! Great work

## TODO

Test on Ipad + Enable iPad support

Player Box
 - See and Track
   - Monarch
   - Initiative
 - Button + and -
   - if it's held, it added/removed points by 5 instead of 1 at the time. As an option (from: JaqueLeKappa)

UI & Glitch
 - Only gripe i really have with it is that I don't find it a bit unpolished visually (which is to be expected at at this stage and by no means is meant like an insult).

- Changing the image(Icon) in the background would be fun!
