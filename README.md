# MTG Tracker



## TODO

Player Box
 - See and Track
   - Storm Count
   - Monarch
   - Initiative
 - Button + and -
   - if it's held, it added/removed points by 5 instead of 1 at the time. As an option (from: JaqueLeKappa)

UI & Glitch
 - Only gripe i really have with it is that I don't find it a bit unpolished visually (which is to be expected at at this stage and by no means is meant like an insult).

- Changing the image in the background would be fun!

Change color when in Commander Damage State ?
- Expand button when active with label (Apply) ?

Animate when life = 0, poison = 10, one cmd = 21

Select color within PlayerBox Settings
- Selected colors are inactive
- Refresh players and CommanderDamage boxes on changes
